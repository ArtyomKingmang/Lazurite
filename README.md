## More About Language
>To work you need to install JDK 17+

This language takes advantage of Java and simplifies it. This makes Lazurite quite simple. Basically, the language is used to create games and applications, because it has powerful libraries for this. But on it you can make bots for social networks, work with files, and much more.

Hello World in Lazurite!:

```shell
print("Hello World!")
```

lsoup example:
```cpp
using "lzr.net.lsoup"

lsoup.parser("https://www.lipsum.com")

title = lsoup.select("title")
text = lsoup.select("h3")

println(title)
println(text)
```

async example:
```cpp
using "lzr.utils.async"

func hel(arg) {
    print(arg)
}
async.supply(hel("Hello"))
```

thread example:
```cpp
using "lzr.utils.thread"

func th(arg) {
   println("My ${arg} thread")
}
for(i = 0, i < 10, i++) {
    std.thread(::th, i)
}
```

stream api example:
```cpp
using "lzr.utils.streamApi"

inputArray = range(0, 5) // [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
resultArray = stream(inputArray)
 .custom(::changeNums)
 .toArray()

func changeNums(container) {
    len = length(container)
    result = Array(len)
    for(i = 0, i < len, i++) {
        result[i] = 7
    }
    return result
}

println(resultArray)

```
